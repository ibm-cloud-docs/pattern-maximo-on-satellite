# Storage design
{: #storage-design-mas}

MaximoÂ® Application Suite (MAS) storage options are controlled at the system and application scope. For information about MAS scope definitions, see [Configuring Maximo Application Suite](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=configuring){: external}. MAS application data and data analytics are stored in MongoDB which is a prerequisite for MAS. It is used as the data dictionary for Monitor application. It is also used as the default user registry. The MongoDB instance can run in the Red Hat OpenShift cluster or external to it.

Db2 Warehouse is not a prerequisite for Manage. Db2 11.5 can be used and is installed by the Db2 Universal Operator.
Db2 Warehouse is typically installed as part of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Pak for Data. Create a IBM Db2 Warehouse database for exclusive use by Maximo Manage. You can't reuse a Db2 Warehouse database on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Pak for Data that is already used by another deployed MAS application.
