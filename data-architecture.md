# Architecture decisions for data
{: #data-architecture}

The following tables summarize the data architecture decisions for the deployment of MaximoÂ® Application Suite (MAS) on an {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} on-premises location.

## Architecture decisions for data in MAS
{: #data-residency-mas}

The following are architecture decisions for data for this design.

| Architecture decision | Requirement | Option | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data store | MAS configuration data is stored securely | Store data in MongoDB | Configure MongoDB and at a minimum, the MongoDB administrator needs table creation privileges. | MongoDB is a prerequisite for MAS. The MongoDB instance must support the transport layer security (TLS) communication protocol. For more information, see [TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-transport-encryption/) in  MongoDB documentation.  |

## Architecture decisions for data in Satellite
{: #data-residency-sat}

| Architecture decision | Requirement | Option | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data residency | Data should stay in the region | - Store data in {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location \n - Store data in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} | Store data in {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location | Deploy Cloud Object Storage (COS) in a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location with sufficient computing hosts and raw block storage allocated for provisioning Object Storage. \n  Enable {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Databases (ICD) for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} and deploy PostgreSQL or Redis ICD instances into a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. \n  See [on-premises Cloud Object Storage](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cos-satellite) and [on-premises SAN storage](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-satellite-on-prem). |
