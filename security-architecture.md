|---|---|---|---|---|
| {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) | {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location hosts | {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} | {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}}  | After a host is assigned to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, root SSH access is disabled (per CIS benchmark) and access to the host is controlled by [IAM access](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users) |

|  | Red Hat OpenShift clusters | - [IAM roles](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users) federated with a customer active directory \n [Kubernetes RBAC Roles](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users) | - {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM roles \n Kubernetes role-based access control roles | - Red Hat OpenShift on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} uses IAM [platform and service access roles](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users) to grant users access to the cluster \n - Role-based access control  roles and cluster roles define a set of permissions for how users can interact with Kubernetes resources in the cluster. - Role-based access control  roles can be applied to individual users, groups of users, or service accounts. For more granular access policies to perform specific Kubernetes actions, you can apply [custom RBAC policies](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users). |
